R is an interpreted language, so any code you write to perform a loop is likely to run much more slowly than equivalent code in compiled language like C. (Most of Râ€™s built-in functions are compiled and are therefore very fast.)

* TCP for file transfer :
- The throughput has a hard theoretical limit that depends only on the network round-trip time (RTT) and the packet loss.
- If the slowest link between two communicating hosts is limited to x kilobits/second then you are not going to get more than x kilobits per second of information throughput. 

* UDP
- Used for streaminh.
